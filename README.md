### Project Overview

This project focuses on data visualization, using an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze Adidas sales data. The dashboard includes multiple visualizations and slicers for filtering by years, products, and regions, enabling dynamic exploration of sales trends and performance. Emphasizing only the data visualization aspect, the project aims to present key insights in a clear and accessible manner. The dataset was already clean, so the analysis directly focused on visual representation without requiring data cleaning.
